Beyond the reach of speech and mind</br>
In this world without origin,</br>
Is it eternal as it feels?</br>
Or transitory as it seems!</br>

With an inexpressible truth</br>
The wise attains an immense view</br>
With focused mind and controlled breath</br>
He realizes what he has been through</br>
On his travel to become</br>
The giver of refuge</br>
The lover of solitude</br>

My ill developed mind</br>
Constantly striving you</br>
When your boundless divinity pours</br>
Eternal and infinite virtues</br>

With single minded devotion</br>
And folded palms I speak</br>
Freeing the mind of fear</br>
The liberation I seek</br>
