---(Time) </br>
Our memory it holds</br>
(And I) </br>
I wish it never unfolds</br>
(Because) </br>
The lie we lived, I’ve left behind</br>
(Now I) </br>
I wish for better kind</br>

Far</br>
As far as I could go</br>
And hide</br>
From the things I never showed</br>

(You) </br>
The part of me you owned</br>
(Now you) </br>
You act like you’ve never known</br>
(Oh I) </br>
I mislaid myself for you</br>
(Now I) </br>
I mean nothing to you</br>

Far</br>
As far as I could run</br>
Because I know</br>
It can’t be outdone</br>

Far</br>
As far as I could go</br>
And hide</br>
From the things I never showed</br>
