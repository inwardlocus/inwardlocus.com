title: Silence
date: "2019-12-19"
---Nor in the cold grave</br>
Nor down the deep blue sea</br>
Oh! The silence needs home I thought</br>
Where the life treads free</br>
Where the walls desolate</br>
Where the low wind moans</br>
Just before the dawn.</br>

Silence! Piled up all night.</br>
Came with a vision,</br>
But I failed to realize.</br>
Silence! Life can be loud</br>
As I approach the voice</br>
When the sun begins to rise!</br>
