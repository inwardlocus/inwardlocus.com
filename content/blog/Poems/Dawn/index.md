As I lay dying in the darkness before the dawn </br>
I can see those faces</br>
Some familiar some unknown</br>
They were told, we fight</br>
Because of all the right reasons,</br>
The only reason I can see now is to suffer and mourn</br>
As I lay dying in the darkness before the dawn</br>
 
All killings and bloodsheds and deaths of our own</br>
Sacrifice they’d call it,</br>
but it’s just a stepping stone</br>
Soldiers falling down one by one,</br>
Marching ahead riding the history,</br>
‘My men never fail me!”</br>
the lord is drenched in the victory</br>
Sworn to their master,</br>
these men were strayed from home</br>
Once had fire flames in their hands,</br>
now remain on this battlefield stoned</br>
As I lying in the darkness before the dawn</br>
