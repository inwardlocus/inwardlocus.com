Amidst the spring flowers, in a freezing snow, </br>
Seated alone on a mountain top.</br>

The mountain had no beginning, the cold knew not its year.</br>
Emptiness was scattered, the land disappeared.</br>

Serene holding of flower, meeting of mind in a smile.</br>
One becomes the autumn moon, breeze between the pines.</br>

In a boundless space, rivers, hills and lands,</br>
In time without beginning and end.</br>
Unless we achieve enlightenment,</br>
How are we to possess a mind</br>
That sees through and casts away</br>
And becomes the ONE nature, the TRUE kind.</br>

In a delusion, I'm attached to home,</br>
Remembered "The form is void." Forgetting "The void too is form."</br>
Seated on a mountain top, I see the life rapidly passes.</br>
Too busy and exhausted, ignored the beauty that process amasses.</br>

Forget the rush, everything takes time.</br>
The moon apears, the flower blossoms.</br>
Escape the despair, positively transform,</br>
Only thing it takes is to change the attitude of mind.</br>

If our disposition is sunny, the world is bright sunshine.</br>
With an attitude of Zen joy, life will be bathed in a sunshine.</br>
