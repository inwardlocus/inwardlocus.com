I have known this man </br>
For quite a long time</br>
A lot has been said about him</br>
A lot can be said about him</br>
I am sure he doesn't mind</br>

So this man lived in a cave</br>
It didn't matter, night or day</br>
Darkness wouldn't escape</br>
Emptiness would fill the gap</br>
While he stayed in there dismayed</br>

His silence was maddening</br>
**His will was deprived of words**</br>
Rage he was battling</br>
For reasons were unsettling</br>
**His only salvation was absurd**</br>

He wasn't afraid of the darkness</br>
**Within him he had seen the light**</br>
Secrets he had been keeping</br>
Now afloat in sinking feelings</br>
**And confusion was out of sight**</br>

All the pain he had felt</br>
All the miseries he had known</br>
He painted on his walls</br>
Knowing he was the one at fault</br>
In the darkness before the dawn</br>

He was ready to let the light in</br>
Doubts were fading in the shades</br>
Past was forgettable</br>
Future was meaningless</br>
**But in this moment he wasn't afraid**</br>

**In his madness he was awakened**</br>
Identity he could no longer hold</br>
Only thing he could offer or feel</br>
Was the vacancy, his mind revealed</br>
Like a potter and his mold.</br>
