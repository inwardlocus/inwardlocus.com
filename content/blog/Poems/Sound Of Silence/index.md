Eyes are looking for </br>
What is to be found within.</br>
And calling for those</br>
who hear nothing</br>
but the silence</br>
the sound within.</br>
Like the fish</br>
In the ocean,</br>
Unaware of the ocean</br>
So close to be</br>
Is a barrier </br>
The distance</br>
Ignites the passion.</br>
The running</br>
Is useless,</br>
Things i thrive.</br>
Forgetting the fact</br>
That I am the subject</br>
“The One” inside</br>
Beneath the superimposed “I”.</br>
Casting the body</br>
Far aside.</br>
That is where </br>
I have always wanted to be.</br>
The running stops</br>
For the sake of the end.</br>
This void feels good.</br>
This feel existent.</br>
This actuality is the end.</br>
</br>
I am singular</br>
I am existent</br>
This non duality </br>
Is shapeless.</br>
**I had seen the world</br>
Just Now.</br>
Where has it gone?</br>**
