Traceless like a stream and cloud </br>
Beyond the barrier</br>
Without a doubt</br>
Unfettered at last,</br>
Like a nomadic monk,</br>
Coming and going, </br>
Without a word</br>
Denying the fact</br>
Cause and effect</br>
In ups and downs</br>
Of this ordinary life</br>
When I lie at peace</br>
Beside the moon lit window</br>
Neither this world</br>
Nor I exist</br>
For the world outside</br>
The pleasure they seek</br>
Rarely one attains</br>
Pleasure such as this.</br>
