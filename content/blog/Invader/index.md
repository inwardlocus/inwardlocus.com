Shortened my circle</br>
Narrowed my mind</br>
Blackened my emotion</br>
Taking one step at a time</br>
It hurts when I care</br>
It hurts when I don't</br>
Being a part of the whole</br>
That isn’t real</br>
Open that door</br>
It isn’t locked</br>
I’m running out of blames</br>
Truth to be told</br>
Memories are cropped</br>
Feelings have faded</br>
Settling for superficial</br>
The life I’ve invaded</br>
