Of what was and what could be</br>
Standing across a funeral pyre</br>
Visibly shaken, I am shocked</br>
Rather uptight, tongue tight</br>

Fire flames, pile of woods</br>
Rustling trees, a familiar scene</br>
Still in slumber, mind at ease</br>
Stood here before, like in dream I have been</br>

Seconds fly while eternity I burrow</br>
Believed they were free, in a self-imposed cage</br>
They walked right by, my eyes followed</br>
Yet still I am here, in the depths of my rage</br>

Stiff as a plank, locked in a stare</br>
Like a rooted tree, I gawked</br>
I was ceased, surprisingly pleased</br>
Like in formation, a metamorphic rock</br>

As the vision blurred</br>
Finally I broke free</br>
Distant albeit aware</br>
Silhouetted face</br>
Perpetual revelation</br>
Like a puzzling grace</br>
Strange but true</br>
Awaken! All that I am</br>
It is you.</br>
