#### Loneliness. Despair. Death. 

If these words could ring a bell, tune can only be the famous, haunting ['Nutshell' by Alice in Chains](https://youtu.be/9EKi2E9dVY8). Such an emotional, heart wrenching acoustic instrumentation and guitar solo. And of course, in this world wide web of social media, this song sublimely expresses the frustration for privacy. Media, politics, internet, television are all attacking our minds constantly and they are raping our sense of self. And the sad part is we don’t even realize this. We have become mind controlled slaves. 

**_We chase misprinted lies_** </br>
**_We face the path of time_**

We live life blindly only to find at some point that what we believed in so far is not true after all. Sudden strike of absurdity. At some point we face reality and we find it surprising. Religion, relations, society are made up lies. We can not buy emotions. We can not sell love.  When the reality wages the war, we find ourselves standing alone at point blank. No guidance, no armour. Just an individual and his absurdity. Bleak and lifeless. 

It is difficult to listen to this song and not to think about death or sadness. I have been repeatedly focusing on borrowed identity.  Life’s like a child's play till we get caught in it. I think it is high time we re-evaluate the ideas and values we measure our lives by. The first and foremost sense of salvation is to exist without impression. Everything else is imposed and meaningless. 

Enjoy this song while you still can!
