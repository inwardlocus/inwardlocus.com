####“The less people know, the more stubbornly they know it.” ~ [Osho](https://www.osho.com/)
It is common belief to detach from worldly affairs once people start to explore spiritual aspect of life. People easily fall into trap of Karma Bondage and start to believe in inactivity. It is naive to believe that any sort of inactivity is a tool for liberation. </br>

Inactivity is not a spiritual way. Spirituality is not at all about being a silent witness and let things happen around us, good or bad. **Peace of mind can never be found in acceptance of injustice of whatever kind.** It is not a spiritual nature to turn our face away from our responsibilities. Those who want to escape from responsibilities and be inactive have never understood the true purpose of spiritual exposure. </br>

#####Spirituality is all about hard work, lively hood, desire to feel alive, forbearance and total awareness in our action.

If we are not able to resist and fight evil, how can we expect to defeat evil thought and disbelief? **The main purpose of spirituality is to change our vision and transform the inner consciousness.** And it can never happen out of inactivity.</br>

Start at once. Now. Let go of laziness and fears. Prepare your mind set to resist and forbear difficulties of life. And keep growing to reach your higher self through your conscious actions and awareness. That is the true spirituality.
