We must never stop dreaming. Dreams provide nourishment for the soul, just as the meal does for the body. Many times in our life we see our dreams shattered and our desires frustrated, but we have to continue dreaming. If we don't, our soul dies and agape cannot reach it. </br>

As the famous saying goes,

##### Amidst the cold winter, I found within me, an invincible summer.

Don’t let life simply proceed in its own direction towards its own fate. It’s simple to lead the life you imagine. Making decisions is the beginning and to make right decision you need to have a plan. And to build that plan you need to seed the idea in your mind. So start dreaming. Remember your dreams. Fight for it. Fight the good fight. Don’t let the fear blind your vision. You are capable at any time in your life of doing whatever you dream of. </br>

#### Start dreaming. Follow the omens.
