Be supple mentally. Strength does not lie in being firm and strong but in being pliable. The pliable tree stands in a gale. Gather the strength of a swift mind. Life is strange, so many things happen unexpectedly; mere resistance will not solve any problem. One needs infinite pliability and a single heart. Life is a razorâ€™s edge, and one has to walk on that path with exquisite care and with pliable wisdom. </br>
