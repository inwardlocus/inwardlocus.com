I find it wise and kind</br>
To be somewhat blind</br>
As I go through life eluding flaws</br>
Even when I find them</br>
And try to look for the reason</br>
Grasp the virtue behind them</br>

The world will adjust, it’s absurd</br>
It’s crazy to resist and fight with the infinite.</br>
Only to go down at last in the wrestle!</br>

##### A wise man once advised,</br>

To shape into god’s plan and surrender one's own will,</br>
Like the water adjusts in a vessel</br>
