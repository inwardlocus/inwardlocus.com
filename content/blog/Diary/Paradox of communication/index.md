Ability of changing mind is the uncomfortable luxury one can have. People make assumptions and these assumptions design the various aspects of life.</br>

**David Bohm States,</br>**
_It is clear that if we are to live in harmony with ourselves and with nature, we need to be able to communicate freely in a creative movement in which no one permanently holds to or otherwise defends his own ideas._</br>
