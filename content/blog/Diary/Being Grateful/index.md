When I look around me, I see everything in a rush. This chase invokes complaints and more desires. But when I stop and take a look behind, I see beautiful moments I would have missed, small things left unappreciated. And I realize, how they meant to me at times. What life would have been without them. In a pursuit of anticipated happiness, I realized, I missed thanking the god, for being always there. We can have dreams, we can have desires. And for what we have already achieved, we should have gratitude to the Almighty.

**Dear God! I wanna take a minute, </br>not to ask for anything from you,</br>but simply to say Thank You, For all I have.**

_<span style="color:orangered">
What you think, that the world owes you?</br>
What's gonna set you free?</br>
Look inside and you'll see</br>
When you've got so much to say it's called gratitude</br>
And that's right</br></span>_
